# korsbakken_python_utils
Python utility code and helper functions by and for myself.

## Purpose and intent

The Python code is primarily a store for helper functions and classes that I
have written and used in other projects, for copy-paste reuse in other projects.
It is written by myself ad for myself, but others who find it useful may use it.

If you spot bugs or have suggestions for features, feel free to create an issue
or submit a pull request. Though I make no promises that I will act on them or
even respond, depends on the time available.

## License

This code is licensed under a GPL license (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)), which
requires you to license any modifications you make under the same open license.
If you need to use it for purposes where that is a showstopper, get in touch to
see if we can work something out.

Note that there are no warranties or guarantees that this code will be safe,
secure or fulfill any particular function, and I assume no liability for its
use, not even to the extent required by law. By using this code, you agree and
guarantee not to use it for any purpose that may impose any form of legal
liabilty on the original author, and will yourself assume any such liabilities
that might arise.
